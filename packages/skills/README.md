# `@ifi/oh-pi-skills`

> 17 on-demand skill packs that teach pi how to handle specific tasks.

## Why use this?

Prompts are great for one-shot tasks, but skills go deeper. A skill is a set of instructions that pi loads when the user asks for that kind of work. It gives pi domain knowledge, workflows, and conventions for specific topics.

Skills activate **automatically** — when you say "search the web for X", pi loads the `web-search` skill. When you ask for a claymorphism design, pi loads the `claymorphism` skill.

## How skills work

- Each skill lives in its own directory under `skills/<skill-name>/`
- Contains a `SKILL.md` file with instructions for pi
- Pi loads the skill when the user's request matches the skill's description
- Skills stay loaded for the duration of the task
- You can explicitly invoke a skill with `/<skill-name>`
